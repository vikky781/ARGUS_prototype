"""Seeded Personalized PageRank risk head.

SCOPE LIMITATION #1 (permanent, by design — not something to work around): the
architecture doc specifies propagation over CO_SPEND + SAME_ENTITY edges. This
repo never produces SAME_ENTITY edges — that is Dev B's ER pass 2
(er/embed_cluster.py, out of scope here per CLAUDE.md). This module
propagates over CO_SPEND only. Also documented in docs/contracts.md.

SCOPE LIMITATION #2 (a consequence of the Phase 2 ER diagnosis, not a bug in
THIS module): ER pass 1 (argus.er.union_find) currently produces ZERO
CO_SPEND edges on this dataset. Diagnosed in Phase 2: the only transactions
with multiple genuinely-distinct input wallets are CoinJoin rounds, which
pass 1 must skip to avoid over-merging; and the change-address heuristic
never links two DIFFERENT wallets given how this dataset's generator builds
"change" (it always returns to the literal same wallet). Net effect: with
zero CO_SPEND edges, personalized PageRank propagation is currently a no-op
beyond the seed set itself — every seed keeps its personalization weight,
every other node gets exactly 0, and "distance from nearest seed" is 0 for
seeds and undefined (infinite/unreachable) for everyone else. The algorithm
below is written to propagate correctly the moment CO_SPEND (or a future
SAME_ENTITY) has real edges — nothing here would need to change for that.
