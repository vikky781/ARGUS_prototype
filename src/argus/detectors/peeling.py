"""Classical peeling-chain detector.

Walks FUNDS/PAYS edges from the graph to find sequences of single-input,
single-dominant-output transactions whose dominant amount strictly decreases
hop over hop — the same structural signal argus.synth.patterns plants.

This is Dev A's classical/structural detector only. Dev B's
detectors/pattern_sim.py (embedding-similarity variant) would append MORE rows
to the same artifacts/scores_pattern.parquet later — not implemented here.
